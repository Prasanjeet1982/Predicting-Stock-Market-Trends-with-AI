# Stock Market Prediction with AI

This project demonstrates how to use machine learning models, including XGBoost and LSTM, to predict stock market trends. It includes a training script to train the models and a FastAPI application for making real-time predictions through a web interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or later
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-prediction.git
   cd stock-market-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Training the Models

To train the XGBoost and LSTM models, follow these steps:

1. Place your training dataset in a CSV file (e.g., `data.csv`) with appropriate columns.

2. Modify the `scripts/train.py` script to preprocess your data and set hyperparameters.

3. Run the training script:

   ```sh
   python scripts/train.py
   ```

   The trained models will be saved in the `models` directory.

## Running the FastAPI Application

To run the FastAPI application for making predictions:

1. Ensure that the models are trained (see the previous section).

2. Start the FastAPI server:

   ```sh
   uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

3. Access the application in your browser or through API requests:

   - Web Interface: `http://localhost:8000`
   - API Documentation: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## API Documentation

The API documentation can be accessed at `http://localhost:8000/docs` when the FastAPI application is running. It provides an interactive interface to test predictions and understand the API endpoints.
